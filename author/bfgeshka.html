<h6 class="subheader" title="2019-01-05T05:42:00+09:00">Sat 05 January 2019

<p><strong>All of this is about this article: https://www.linux.com/blog/2019/1/7-things-desktop-linux-needs-2019</strong></p>
<p>It's sad to see on the website about linux this article, deprecating the very subject of this resource. While linux.com often wasn't all around a staple of linux scene, at least articles were moderate in balancing personal opinions and fact analysis.</p>
<p><em>7 Things Desktop Linux Needs in 2019</em> basically ignores all existing facts about linux ecosystem and implies that it's time to destroy it once and for all. Let's look at each of these 7 points:</p>
<h4>One Distro to Rule them All</h4>
<p>Bringing this argument as #1 is astonoshing. Since Linux is all about your choice, then <em>let's leave no choice at all</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, it's easier to maintain sole OS distribution. But everybody wants something specific from their distro. Make it appealing for majority of the users and then you leave behind all others - including server installations, enthusiast users, someone who needs different defaults and so on. Make it minimal and then all appeal for novice users is lost. Make it "all inclusive" and then get bloated distro as a result.</p>
<p>Now we already have de facto "goto" linux distributive - Ubuntu (at least this is how it appears to me. Yes, there are derivatives, RHEL and others. But it is Ubuntu in a sense that you'll most likely to get a .deb package for it before anything else). At least now many companies are orienting for it when creating their product, for better or for worse. Official declaration of some specific distro will only polarize ecosystem, shifting the balance and killing many interesing projects due to the lack of manpower and killing even more in the infancy state. How is it any good is beyond me.</p>
<p>Now many are making it easier for generic linux user rather than user of specific distro. Alongside <code>.deb</code>'s there are usual tarballs, and binary dependencies are kept sane for average linux user. We may lose it all in the case of unification.</p>
<h4>A Viable X.org Replacement</h4>
<p>Yes, upgrading Xorg would be very nice. The problem is that it requires a lot of support from software developers of existing and new pieces of software, adapting by ecosystem, providing support of previous generation, actual painless migration system and so on. It is a lot of work, some part of it is already in progress for years. No manifesto will change this fact.</p>
<h4>Culling the App Herd</h4>
<p>Maintaining package management system itself is a constant lot of work. Now add maintaining of packages for primary needs - toolchain, system libraries, configurations and so on. All of it requires attention for testing, patching and otherwise supporting software. And then add all those thousands of miscellanious packages with who knows how many users. Some packages will break constantly, some will only need occasional tweaking, and some have so little attention that can be broken for years without anyone noticing it.</p>
<p>All in all, maintaining all of it is hellish work, success of which strongly depends on user feedback. So, next time when you notice some broken package - do not white an article about it. Instead, write to package management bugtracker, and all of it will be for the better.</p>
<h4>Real-Time Antivirus and Anti-Malware</h4>
<p>Now there's interesting piece of information: these do exist. And they did for quite some time, and they were made by already known companies in this area. Reason why many people do not know about this is that usually you do not need real-time protection. That's because linux (and other *nix-alike OSs) is secure by design and doesn't really require protection on this layer.</p>
<p>Software is being installed via protected repositories. Applications are restricted in actions by OS design. There is additional hardening for permission system (like SElinux and AppArmor), also - depending on distro - hardening for binaries (PIE, stack protection and so on). All users usually are advised to be causious of 3rd party installation sources.</p>
<p>All this is not ideal, but it is good defence in depth, and if it's still not enough then there is always a selection of antimalware and antivirus solutions.</p>
<h4>Prosumer-Grade Apps</h4>
<p>This one is wrong on so many level. First, let's not use marketing buzzwords and just call people in question "creators". Second, there's plenty of professional-grade software for musicians, artists, designers, editors and so on, available in one way or another - native or via <code>wine</code>. And there are people who use it. It is a shame that many professionals aren't informed about this software.</p>
<p>Even though there is also a different problem - some professional software pieces are considered irreplaceble, even though OSS with similar featureset may exist. For example, there are many artists who simply cannot draw in something aside from their favourite Adobe Photoshop. For those people these is a possibility of lauching software via <code>wine</code>.</p>
<p>And this was about artist part of the crowd. There are developers of all sorts - and there's no doubt that linux environment is great for software developers at least (but not only) because of stability, flexibility and customizibility of the working environment.</p>
<h4>Better Font Rendering</h4>
<p>Linux font rendering was great since <em>infinality</em> for fontconfig appeared, and then partly adopted by it. Linux font rendering has it all for great visual representation of text and goes with sane default configulation. More, it can be customized in any way.</p>
<p>Font rendering for Windows never surpassed one for linux or Mac. And Mac font rendering appears better simply because apple desktop devices on average are using higher resolution display. If there is evidence that Mac font rendering is objectively better than one in linux, I'm not aware of it.</p>
<h4>More Companies Shipping Quality Products</h4>
<p>This question only follows the line of OS distribution. This message should be directed to hardware vendors. Even though in the end it would be valuable for the community, this relationship must be discussed between vendors and heads of big distribution projects. Right now linux is being more and more appealing for vendors, all there should be done is keeping it on - for example, userspace software is mostly here, but required device drivers sometimes can be a problem, especially for deployment with new hardware.</p>
